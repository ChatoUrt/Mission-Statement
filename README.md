# Mission-Statement

I'm Jonatan Urutia, a web software student. I've worked in a company as an intern making the design for both of the main web pages of the company, getting knowledge in wordpress, VS code and Git. I'm looking forward to grow as a full stack web development, getting more knowledge about new technologies and features to implement it not only in web pages but also in own projects making new programs for the area of entretainment. I'm persistent, fast learning and efficient who is pretty sure will boost careers for streamers with new streamers tools, making an agency for new services for people on the industry, making a new era for the internet content.🎮🌎🖥️
